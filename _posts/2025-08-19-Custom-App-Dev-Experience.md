# Overview
While I am not a developer, I am not inexperienced at development.  Whether it was learning BASIC and assembly on a Commodore 64, to learning TypeScript to write Playwright tests for an Angular web app, I've been hands-on for minor development tasks. **However, *managing* custom app dev projects is a core skill and area I have extensive experience in.**

This post is meant to provide some high-level insight into that experience on a few of the projects I've managed.
