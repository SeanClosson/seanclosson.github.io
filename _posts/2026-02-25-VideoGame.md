## Peaceful Games
I've never created a video game before.  I've used Unreal Engine for video production work, but never to make a game; it's so intimidating! When the news story about Alex Pretti came out so soon after Renee Good was killed, I was thinking of video games and how they're so often violent and we have enough violence in the world.  If I was to ever make a game, I'd want to make something peaceful. One of the first images I think about when I think about peace, is that of a flower.  Why couldn't I make a video game about making flowers? Instead of shooting or destroying something, how about we "build" flowers by catching falling petals and affixing them to a stem?

## So I Did a Thing
I decided to try my hand at making a game. Then I decided it may be easier to learn Godot than UE5 for a 2D game. I'm learning Godot 4.6 and GDScript so I can take what's in my head and make it real. It's still in progress, but I'm very pleased with the amount of progress I have been able to make in such a short time! Having GenAI available to ask questions of is like having a really smart (and patient!) developer sitting next to me while I stumble though learning the game engine. Since nobody reads this, I'm think of making my v0.5 version available [here](https://seanclosson.github.io/games/Bloomfall/Bloomfall.html) for trying out.  Email me if you see this and played the game; I'd love to read your thoughts on it.
